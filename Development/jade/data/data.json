        "Campbell reprises his role as Ash, the stock boy, aging lothario and chainsaw-handed monster hunter who has spent the last 30 years avoiding responsibility, maturity and the terrors of the Evil Dead. When a Deadite plague threatens to destroy all of mankind, Ash is finally forced to face his demons -personal and literal.  Destiny, it turns out, has no plans to release the unlikely hero from &#8220;Evil&#8217;s&#8221; grip."

            "In addition to the franchise&#8217;s commercial success, <em>Spider-Man</em> (2002) won that year&#8217;s People&#8217;s Choice Award as Favorite Motion Picture, earned a pair of Oscar<sup>&reg;</sup> nominations (for VFX and Best Sound) and also collected two GRAMMY<sup>&reg;</sup> nominations (for Best Score and Chad Kroeger&#8217;s song &#8220;Hero&#8221;). The sequel (2004) won the Academy Award<sup>&reg;</sup> for Best Visual Effects (with two more nominations, Best Sound and Sound Editing) and two BAFTA nominations (for VFX and Best Sound), among dozens of other honors.",
            "Most recently, Raimi is known for directing <em>Oz the Great and the Powerful</em>, a commanding prequel to one of Hollywood&#8217;s most beloved stories. Grossing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars at the worldwide box office, <em>Oz</em> has also been elected for awards across the board, including a nomination at the People&#8217;s Choice Awards for Favorite Family Movie, and winning Film Music at the BMI Film & TV Awards.",

He left his studies at Michigan State University to form Renaissance Pictures with future producer Rob Tapert and their longtime friend, actor Bruce Campbell, with whom he made his very first film, <em>Within the Woods</em>, a short horror film they used to raise money to make a feature. That resulting horror classic, <em>The Evil Dead</em> (1982), financed and produced with investments from local business people and doctors, became a hit at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival and spawned a sequel, <em>Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn</em> (1987), which, like the original, showcased Raimi&#8217;s inventive, imaginative direction and offbeat humor.",
            "Raimi next turned to the fantasy genre, writing and directing the comic book-inspired <em>Darkman</em> (1990), starring Liam Neeson and Frances McDormand, then followed with 1993&#8217;s <em>Army of Darkness</em>, a comic sword and sorcery fantasy starring Bruce Campbell.",
            "The mid-&#8217;90s also found Raimi producing two telefilms (with friend and partner Tapert) that would become the genesis of a pair of highly popular syndicated series&#8212;&#8220;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&#8221; (on which he served as executive producer during the program&#8217;s four-year run) and the successful companion series, &#8220;Xena: Warrior Princess&#8221; which aired from 1995-2001. His television work also includes executive producing the CBS series &#8220;American Gothic&#8221; and STARZ graphic sword and sandals series, &#8220;Spartacus: War of the Damned.&#8221;",
            "Raimi continued his collaboration with Tapert in his production company Ghost House Pictures, which produced such films as <em>The Grudge</em>, <em>Boogeyman</em>, <em>30 Days of Night</em>, <em>The Messengers</em> and <em>The Possession</em>.",
            "Raimi&#8217;s work has been a favorite on the film festival circuit, with the filmmaker winning a Best Director honor for <em>Darkman</em> at the 1990 Sitges-Catalonian Festival in Spain; the Critics Award for <em>Army of Darkness</em> at the 1992 Fantasporto Festival in Portugal; the Golden Raven, also for <em>Army of Darkness</em>, at the 1992 Brussels International Festival; and a Grand Prize nomination for the same title at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival in France.

Completed piecemeal over four years, the film first gained notoriety in England where it became the best-selling video of 1983, beating out <em>Poltergeist</em>. After its appearance at Cannes, where Stephen King dubbed it &#8220;the most ferociously original horror film of the year,&#8221; New Line Cinema stepped forward to release <em>Evil Dead</em> in the U.S.", 
            "After co-producing <em>Crimewave</em>, Campbell moved to Los Angeles and quickly gained a foothold producing or starring in genre films such as the <em>Maniac Cop</em> series, <em>Lunatics: A Love Story</em>, <em>Moontrap</em> and <em>Mindwarp</em>, a post-apocalyptic <em>Jeremiah Johnson</em>, during which he met his wife-to-be, filmmaker, Ida Gearon.",
            "Campbell then rejoined his Detroit colleagues to star and co-produce the second and third films in the <em>Evil Dead</em> trilogy, completing 12 years of work on the cult favorite. This rough-and-tumble background was a plus as Campbell made his foray into television, first starring in the highly touted Fox series &#8220;The Adventures Of Brisco County Jr.,&#8221; then as a recurring guest-star on the hit show &#8220;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman.&#8221; With these under his belt, Campbell easily made the transition to director, helming numerous episodes and recurring as the King of Thieves in the #1 syndicated &#8220;Hercules: The Legendary Journeys&#8221;, and its follow-up phenomenon, &#8220;Xena: Warrior Princess.&#8221;",
            "Bruce has since expanded his range on television, with appearances in Disney's TV movies <em>Gold Rush</em>, and their update of <em>The Love Bug</em>. He teamed up with Fox again for the hit TV film <em>Tornado!</em>, and starred in NBC's top-rated <em>In The Line of Duty: Blaze of Glory.</em> Following decidedly dramatic turns on the acclaimed series &#8220;Homicide: Life on the Street&#8221; and &#8220;The X-Files,&#8221; he enjoyed a recurring role on Showtime&#8217;s edgy TV industry comedy, &#8220;Beggars and Choosers.&#8221;",

But Campbell didn't abandon his film roots. During that time, he had featured roles in the blockbuster <em>Congo</em>, <em>John Carpenter's Escape From LA</em>, and the award-winning independent crime drama, <em>Running Time</em>. He followed these up with roles in Paramount's romantic comedy, <em>Serving Sara</em>, Jim Carrey's <em>The Majestic</em>, and all three of Sam Raimi's blockbuster <em>Spider-Man</em> movies. After a return to episodic television in the swashbuckling series, &#8220;Jack of All Trades,&#8221; Campbell took the title role in MGM's cult sleeper <em>Bubba Ho-Tep</em>. His directorial debut, <em>Man with the Screaming Brain</em>, premiered on the Sci Fi Channel, and Dark Horse Comics published the comic adaptation. Campbell has since made the leap into other forms of entertainment, and is enjoying his role as an author with back-to-back New York Times bestsellers: a memoir entitled &#8220;If Chins Could Kill: Confessions of a B Movie Actor,&#8221; and his first novel, &#8220;Make Love the Bruce Campbell Way.&#8221;",

He also voiced the character of Mayor Shelbourne in the animated hit <em>Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs</em>. In 2011, Campbell voiced the role of Rod Torque Redline in <em>Cars 2</em>, the sequel to the smash Disney animated feature.",
